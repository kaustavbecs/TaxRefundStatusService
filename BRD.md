Designing a TurboTax Service for Checking the Most Recent Tax Refund Status
Introduction
In this system design interview, we're tasked with designing a system similar to TurboTax, specifically focused
on providing users with the status of their most recent tax refund. This system is expected to be used after
customers have finished filing their taxes. This system is critical for maintaining user trust and satisfaction, as
it directly relates to financial matters which are of significant concern to users. Users are also interested to
know the amount of time it would take for the refund to be available to them, and the system under
consideration should interface with an AI model that predicts this.
Problem Statement
The system needs to efficiently and reliably handle queries related to the status of tax refunds. Given the
sensitive nature of tax information and the high demand for such a service, particularly around tax season,
this system must be both secure and highly available. The system should handle integration with the AI
model, deal with data required to train the AI model as well as make inference requests with.
Scope
For the purpose of this interview, we will limit the scope of our design to the following::
• User requests their most recent tax refund status
• If refund is yet to be available to the users, an AI model predicts the estimated time for the refund to
become available.
Candidates are expected to design the client application with usability in mind, providing clear guidance on
how users can check their refund status and what actions they can take if there are issues with their refund.
Constraints and Assumptions
Given the nature of the problem, we will work under the following assumptions:
• High traffic is expected around tax season, with significantly lower traffic the rest of the year.
• Tax refund status updates may not be instantaneous and could be subject to delays from external
systems (e.g., IRS processing systems).
• Users expect accurate and timely information.
• Security and privacy are paramount, given the sensitive financial data involved.
Based on these assumptions; considerations for system capacity, security protocols, data accuracy, and
response time are critical.
