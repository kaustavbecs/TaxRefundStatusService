## Context Rules

When working with this codebase, Roo (AI assistant) should follow these context rules:

1. **Always Include BRD.md**: Roo should always include the Business Requirements Document (BRD.md) in context when analyzing or making changes to the codebase. This document contains critical information about the system's purpose, scope, and requirements.

2. **System Overview**: This project is a TurboTax Service for checking tax refund status, which allows users to check their most recent tax refund status and provides AI-powered predictions for when refunds will be available.
