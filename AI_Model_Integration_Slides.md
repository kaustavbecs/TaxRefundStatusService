# AI Model Integration Slides for Tax Refund Status Service

## Slide 1: AI Model Integration Architecture

**Title: Tax Refund Prediction: ML Pipeline Architecture**

![ML Pipeline Architecture]

**Key Components:**

1. **Data Sources**
   - Online Operational Database (Tax Files, Processing Events, Predictions)
   - Real-time user interactions and IRS status updates

2. **ETL & Analytics Layer**
   - Daily extraction to offline analytics database
   - Feature engineering and statistical aggregation
   - Historical pattern analysis across tax categories

3. **Model Hosting Infrastructure**
   - REST API endpoints for prediction requests
   - Preprocessing pipeline for consistent transformations
   - Health monitoring and scaling capabilities

4. **Integration Points**
   - Client UI ↔ Prediction API: Real-time refund status predictions
   - Monitoring System ↔ Model: Performance tracking and alerts
   - ETL ↔ Training Pipeline: Data flow for continuous improvement

**Bottom Line:** *"Our ML architecture enables accurate refund predictions while maintaining system reliability and adaptability to changing tax patterns."*

## Slide 2: Training Workflow & Intelligent Retraining

**Title: Continuous Learning: Training Workflow & Smart Retraining**

![Training Workflow]

**Training Pipeline:**

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Rich feature extraction from tax categories and deductions
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables
   - Temporal aggregation of processing patterns

2. **Model Architecture**
   - Random Forest Regressor optimized for prediction accuracy
   - Hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation
   - Versioned model artifacts with metadata

**Hybrid Retraining Strategy:**

| Trigger Type | Description | Advantage |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Schedule-Based** | Monthly retraining cycle | Captures seasonal patterns |
| **Performance-Based** | Triggered when accuracy drops below thresholds | Maintains prediction quality |
| **Feature Drift-Based** | Detects changes in tax filing patterns | Early warning system |

**Real-World Example:**
- New tax credit introduced in January
- Feature drift detected in February (15% increase in specific deduction)
- Proactive retraining before performance degradation
- Result: Maintained 92% prediction accuracy despite policy change

**Bottom Line:** *"Our intelligent retraining approach ensures prediction accuracy even as tax policies and filing patterns evolve."*
