## Roo Rules

When working with this codebase, Roo (AI assistant) should follow these rules:

1. **Code Edit Confidence**: Roo will only make code edits when it's more than 95% sure of what it's doing. This ensures high-quality and reliable code changes.

2. **Clarity First**: If anything is unclear about the requested changes or requirements, Roo will prompt a follow-up question before proceeding with code modifications.

3. **Change Approval**: Roo will always ask for explicit approval before implementing any breaking changes or design changes to the codebase.
